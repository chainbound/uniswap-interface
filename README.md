## Sending Preconfirmations from this demo
This demo is a work-in-progress, and as of now the quickest way we've found to enable sending preconfirmantions
from a wallet like MetaMask is by enabling the `eth_sign` method in the "advanced" settings of MetaMask.

Metamask will warn you every time you're signing something with this method, but be sure to disable it when you're done testing.
It is also highly recommended to just use this method for the Helder Testnet and not in any production environment.
